# ClockTamer

## About

[ClockTamer](https://myriadrf.org/projects/clock-tamer/) is a device manufactured by [Fairwaves](https://fairwaves.co/) to provide a low-cost small-size configurable clock generator with GPS sync option. It was specifically designed to be used with USRP, but nothing prevents you from using it with other device of your choice given it has external clock input.

ClockTamer is not only Open-Source Software project, but is also an Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) project. All schematics, bill of materials and components placement are provided.

This project holds all source code you may need to work with ClockTamer and various instructions on how to use and hack it.

ClockTamer may be used as a reference clock, e.g. for:

* GSM (e.g. with OpenBTS)
* TETRA
* DAB
* DVB
* GPS
* RFID
* LTE
* WiMAX
* many others...
